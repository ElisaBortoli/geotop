GEOtop
======

GEOtop is a distributed model of the mass and energy balance of the
hydrological cycle, which is applicable to simulations in continuum in
small catchments. GEOtop deals with the effects of topography on the
interaction between energy balance and hydrological cycle with peculiar
solutions.

GEOtop is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

You can find more informations about GEOtop on the following website

where the model is briefly described and links to papers and other useful
websites have been collected.

Installation
============

To install GEOtop you need the following libraries and tools:

- CMake 2.6 or later (optional but recommended: ccmake ncurses ui)
- Boost 1.49 or later (filesystem, system, iostreams, regex,
  program_options, unit_test_framework and spirit_classic)
- MeteoIO 2.4.2
  (http://models.slf.ch/p/meteoio/downloads/get/MeteoIO-2.4.2-src.tar.gz)

GEOtop is known to run under the following Operating Systems:

    - Mac OS X 10.8 or later
    - CentOS 6.5 or later
    - Debian 7

GEOtop has been reported to run also under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

GEOtop has NOT been tested on Microsoft Windows either with Cygwin or
MinGW compiler. This configuration therefore is NOT supported: you are
on your own.

Compilation options
===================

     Option                     Default
 BUILD_STATIC                     OFF
 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                 RELEASE
 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /usr/local
 ENABLE_INTERNAL_METEODISTR       ON
 METEOIO_OUTPUT                   OFF
 METEOIO_PATH                     
 PRINT_DOUBLE_PRECISION           OFF
 STAGED_FOR_REMOVING              OFF
 USE_NETCDF                       OFF
 VERBOSE                          OFF

BUILD_STATIC: If set to ON will build GEOtop as a single static binary.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Can be RELEASE or DEBUG. The latter sets up GEOtop
logging to high verbosity and enables GDB support.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Sets the "make install" target directory.

ENABLE_INTERNAL_METEODISTR: If set to ON GEOtop will NOT use MeteoIO for
data interpolation.

METEOIO_OUTPUT: If set to ON GEOtop will use MeteoIO to output ARC
files.

METEOIO_PATH: Path to MeteoIO libraries

PRINT_DOUBLE_PRECISION: If set to ON will print the output files and the
recovery files in GEOtop 1.x compatibility mode. (This will be removed).

STAGED_FOR_REMOVING: If set to ON will compile code that is going to be
removed.

USE_NETCDF: enables experimental NetCDF output.

VERBOSE: increases logging verbosity.
