GEOtop is a fine-scale grid-based simulator that represents the heat and water budgets at and below
the soil surface. It describes the three-dimensional water flow in the soil and the energy exchange
with the atmosphere, considering the radiative and turbulent fluxes. Furthermore, it reproduces the
highly non-linear interactions between the water and energy balance during soil freezing and thawing,
and simulates the temporal evolution of the water and energy budgets in the snow cover and their ef-
fects on soil temperature.

GEOtop is a C++ source code provided under the GPL v3 license.
