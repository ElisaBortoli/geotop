##############
GEOtop Testing (Examples)
##############

This directory contains long tests (1D and 3D)  to check if geotop runs smoothly.
These simulations can also be used as examples. 
They are organized in the following sub-directories:


1D: contains Point simulation ( keyword PointSim=1) (ACTUALLY EMPTY)
3D: contains distributed simulation (keyword PointSim=0 or not defined)

Simulation may last for some hours or several minutes and are useful to manually check  if code runs without any problems for long time.
