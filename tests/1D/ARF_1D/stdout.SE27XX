Attempting to read 'DemFile' in the file 'none': not present in file list
Warning: Dem file not present
Warning: Dem file is not present, and therefore it is not possible to calculate curvature

Warning:: No horizon file found for point type #1. In this case the horizon will be considered always not obscured, i.e. shadow=FALSE
