GEOtop Testing
##############

Tests are automatically executed on `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/geotopmodel/geotop>`_ every push to github performed. A mail will be sent to the committer after the test is run with all the details regarding the test. You can check the log of the execution inside of Travis. 

Since some test is generating an output larger than 4MB of text the complete log is disabled.

How to Execute a Tests
======================

In order to perform  *output-tabs* and *output-maps* check for every test you should install **nose** and **pandas** libraries. If **pandas** is missing the files are compared exactly without considering approximation deltas.

For executing tests you have to use *ctest* command:

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ctest .

Tests are named like:

.. code-block:: text
        
        1D.<TEST_NAME>
        3D.<TEST_NAME>
        1D.<TEST_NAME>.test_runner #executes only output files check
        3D.<TEST_NAME>.test_runner #executes only output files check

You can use Regex for filtering tests and execute only what you need:

.. code-block:: bash
        
        $ ctest -R <REGEX> .

How to Add a test
=================

*Cmake* is configured to check if geotop.inpts file is present in each subdirectory of *tests/1D* and *tests/3D*.
Then the test is added in ctest.
Files inside *output-tabs* and *output-maps* are compared with the outputs within the following directories, if present:

.. code-block:: text

        output-tabs-METEOIO-on
        output-maps-METEOIO-on
        output-tabs-METEOIO-off
        output-maps-METEOIO-off
        output-tabs-SE27XX
        output-maps-SE27XX
