"""
This script will create one test for each directory containing a
``geotop.inpts`` file, will run geotop inside that directory and will
check the output files against the files contained in the ``results``
subdirectory.

Specifically, each test run on a TEST_DIR subdirectory will pass if
and only if:

* TEST_DIR/_SUCCESSFUL_RUN exists and is a file

* for each OUTPUTDIR in TEST_DIR/results:
    for each FILE in OUTPUTDIR:
      - TEST_DIR/OUTPUTDIR/FILE exists and is a file
      - TEST_DIR/OUTPUTDIR/FILE is equal to TEST_DIR/results/OUTPUTDIR/FILE

Adding a new test should be as easy as:

* adding a directory with input files for geotop

* adding a subdirectory ``results`` containing the correct output
  files generated by geotop.
